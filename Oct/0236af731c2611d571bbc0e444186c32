JOHANNESBURG – The massive strike action by the National Union of Mineworkers in the coal sector could have a direct impact on the supply of coal to Eskom. More than 30,000 mineworkers downed tools on Sunday night after a breakdown in wage talks. Eskom said as a customer of the mining companies it is monitoring the strike action from a distance. Spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said as long as the strike is resolved soon it will not affect South Africa’s power supply. “At this stage we’re not panicking because on average in most of our power stations we have more than 30 days of coal stockpile reserves - for now at least we are okay,” said Phasiwe. Should the strike continue for longer than a month then Eskom will get coal from the mining companies’ own stockpiles but this could be very expensive said Phasiwe. “That’s a costly exercise because Eskom will have to transport coal from those mines into the power stations which is a plan C – we don’t want to go there,” he said. Phasiwe said that load-shedding is a worst case scenario if the strike continues for up to two months, but he hopes an agreement will be reached soon. “The strike is not helpful to either the unions or the companies so I’m sure that at some point they will find common ground so that the matter can be resolved,” said Phasiwe.

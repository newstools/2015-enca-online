The case comes before the High Court on Monday with Pamodzi liquidators alleging that the deal was a massive fraud and are demanding over a-billion in damages. PRETORIA - The North Gauteng High Court will hear the second day of argument in a case involving a R1,5-billion claim against the directors of Aurora Empowerment Systems. Advocate Louis Hollander will continue his argument which began late on Monday afternoon. Hollander&39;s main line of attack has been to question the validity of the claim presented to the court. Hollander is arguing on behalf of Aurora directors Thulani Ngubane and Zondwa Mandela, as well as Aurora consultants Solly and Fazel Bhana. The group, along with Khulubuse Zuma, are accused of managing two mines recklessly. The mines were taken over by Aurora in a dubious deal with the liquidators of Pamodzi Gold, which is now the subject of the court battle. The liquidators say Aurora committed fraud when concluding the deal, arguing the company&39;s bid document was fraudulent because Aurora did not have the money to take over the Pamodzi mines. They are also claiming that Aurora mined R122-million in gold during the one and a half year period that it managed the mines and they are demanding the company be made to repay that money. But Hollander says the liquidators have not proven their claim before the court. He argued that the liquidators submitted hardly any paperwork to prove their claim, and that they had only provided gold receipts when asked by the opposing legal teams in the case. Yesterday the court heard from lawyers for Zuma and the liquidators. Advocate Griffiths Madonsela, on behalf of Zuma, distanced his client from any allegations of illegatity. Madonsela said Zuma had not seen the Aurora bid document, and was not involved in the daily management of the company.

JOHANNESBURG – Emerging markets investment group Actis has bought a stake in Food Lover’s Market for R760-million and will help the food retailer expand further, it said on Friday. Food Lover’s Market, reportedly the largest independent food retail group in Africa, has over 120 stores in 11 countries. Actis said it would support the company’s founders Brian and Mike Coppin, together with the existing management team, in continuing to grow their brand. “Brian and his team have carved a niche in the South African food retail landscape, offering a distinguished value proposition to aspirational consumers looking for high quality products at real value. We look forward to working together to continue the Group’s growth story and expanding further within Africa,” Actis Director David Cooke said in a statement. The investment is Actis’s fourth in South Africa in 18 months, following its recent investments in home furnishings retailer Coricraft, sports shoe retailer Tekkie Town, and credit bureau CSH. Actis is a leading multi-asset emerging markets investor. It has a growing portfolio of investments across Asia, Africa and Latin America and $7.6-billion (R109-billion) funds under management.

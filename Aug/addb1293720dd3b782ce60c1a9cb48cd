Demonstrators said officials had destroyed their homes without giving them any notice. "They are very wicked and inhuman," one sex workers called Rachael told NAN, the Nigerian news agency. "How can they destroy our houses without notice, leaving behind some kiosks and canteens that belong to cattle traders?" There were no reports of injuries or arrests at the demonstration. The decision to raze their homes was part of an anti-crime drive by by Willie Obiano, governor of Anambra state where Amansea is located, a regional official told various media. "Anywhere there is brothel, criminals and kidnappers hover around," said Nathan Enemuo head of the Anambra State Urban Development Board.

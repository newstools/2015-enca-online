14 September 2015: A major multi-vehicle accident on the N2 north near Queen Nandi Drive in KwaZulu-Natal has claimed the lives of at least two people. JOHANNESBURG - The Hawks will be taking charge of investigations into alleged fraudulent acts committed by Road Accident fund (RAF) staff.The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomed the move, saying the cases had been transferred to 12 South African Police Service (SAPS) investigating officers since they laid criminal charges against the CEO of the RAF, Dr Eugene Watson and the RAF Board in April this year. That&39;s after the party found evidence documenting large-scale fraud at the fund.It&39;s alleged the RAF sued itself in order to maintain a certain cash flow. Done "without the knowledge, instruction or consent of road accident victims", it could result in delays in completing victims&39; claims, while also adding additional costs to the RAF&39;s already bloated legal bills. The DA said that since laying the charges, information had come into their possession indicating that the RAF used only selected legal firms to represent clients who had no knowledge of this situation. Much of this information had come to them via a party helpline set up to address these issues. A confidential internal audit requested by Watson to establish the extent of the fraud had identified 2,098 similar cases. The scope of the inquiry covered two years and according to the DA, could have cost taxpayers up toÂ R10-billion. The party had, as a result adjusted its affidavit and presented addendums to the Hawks last week.

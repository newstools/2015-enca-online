JOHANNESBURG - Former personal assistant to Nelson Mandela, Zelda la Grange's, controversial Twitter comments have inspired a top-trending hashtag "#Zeldadoesntevenknow". On Saturday, la Grange said, among a litany of other racially-charged tweets, that President Zuma made whites feel unwelcome in South Africa. La Grange said she would ask French President Francois Hollande if he wanted her because "the organisation that praises [Zimbabwean president Robert] Mugabe but condemns [former president FW] De Klerk doesn't want us in SA". "If I was a white investor I would more or less leave now. It's very clear from Jacob Zuma whites are not wanted or needed in South Africa." The Communist Youth League (YCL) on Saturday said that la Grange should apologise for her racist and anti-South African tweets. "Her tweets express bitterness and hatred towards not only our democratically elected president and the majority of our people, but also all of South Africa," said spokesman Khaya Xaba. "She has also disgraced the legacy through which she has become famous, that of her role in working for Tata Nelson Mandela." Following a huge public backlash, la Grange tweeted an apology on the same day. "I apologise unconditionally and without reservation to all South Africans who were offended by my tweets this morning," she said in a statement. "There is no 'but' when hurting people who have nothing to do with your frustration. I am sorry," said La Grange, who had also reverted to her Twitter name "Zelda" after using "Zelda van Riebeeck" during her Twitter outburst. #zeldadoesntevenknow that unless she was lying, she meant what she said, making her a coward for retracting it. Mandela LOVED cowardice.  Additional reporting Sapa

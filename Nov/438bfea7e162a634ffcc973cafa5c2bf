PORT ELIZABETH – Chaos erupted at a packed Port Elizabeth Checkers store on Friday as shoppers fought for products during the Black Friday sale. Security and store management closed the store's doors but that merely agitated the crowd, who then broke down the glass doors and forced their way through. In one of the Facebook videos in the article, shoppers can be seen fighting over packets of frozen chicken. The Black Friday concept is adopted from the American Black Friday, which takes place the day after Thanksgiving. eNCA
